/*! \brief Threshold logic function identification

  Given a truth table, this function determines whether it is a threshold logic function (TF)
  and finds a linear form if it is. A Boolean function is a TF if it can be expressed as

  f(x_1, ..., x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i >= T

  where w_i are the weight values and T is the threshold value.
  The linear form of a TF is the vector [w_1, ..., w_n; T].

  \param tt The truth table
  \param plf Pointer to a vector that will hold a linear form of `tt` if it is a TF.
             The linear form has `tt.num_vars()` weight values and the threshold value
             in the end.
  \return `true` if `tt` is a TF; `false` if `tt` is a non-TF.
